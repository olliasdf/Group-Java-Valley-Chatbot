# Text Retrieval Chatbot

To implement a chatbot based text search engine with GUI. The backend will index the documents in Apache Lucene/Solr. Making simple assumptions that in the front-end user can ask questions like “why” and “how”. For other queries (i.e. non-who and non-how queries), we resort to simple free text search and query Lucene/Solr. Making simple and reasonable assumptions, like restricting the number of results to 3 or 5 or also get images along with text or ask feedback from the user in the GUI! As a final result, we expect a GUI where user can search in a "chat like experience".
